Author: Joyce Liao
Version: 1.0.0



## OVERVIEW
- Create a function that produces and traverse binary trees.
- Create a function that performs breadth-first traversal to a binary tree.


## GETTING STARTED
The program can be run with python3.6 installation and can be best operated in a terminal.


## ARCHITECTURE
1. Create a Class for a Node which is aware of the value as "val" and left and right children as "left" and "right"
2. Create a Class for a BST, which is aware of the root of the tree as "root"
3. This class should accept an iterable as an argument when initialized
4. This class should be aware of depth-first traversal methods for in_order, pre_order, and post_order traversals
5. This class should have the ability to insert
6. The class has a method for breadth-first traversal
