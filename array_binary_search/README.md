#OVERVIEW
Given a list and a value, return the position of the value in the list. Return -1 if the value is not in the list.


#GETTING STARTED
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in an array and a value. Return the position of the value in the list. Return -1 if the value is not in the list.


#ARCHITECTURE
1 - Declare "status" as false
2 - Loop through the list. When the item in the list matches the value, flip the status to be True. Return the position of the matched list item.
3 - If the status is still false after the loop, return -1.
