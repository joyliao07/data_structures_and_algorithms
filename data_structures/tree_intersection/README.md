# BINARY_TREEE: TREE_INTERSECTION


Author: Joyce Liao
Version: 1.0.0




## OVERVIEW
Class BST and its related methods.



## GETTING STARTED
The program can be run with python3.6 installation and can be operated in a terminal.



## ARCHITECTURE
1. Create a Class for a Node which is aware of the value as "val" and left and right children as "left" and "right"
2. Create a Class for a BST, which is aware of the root of the tree as "root"
3. This class should accept an iterable as an argument when initialized
4. This class should be aware of depth-first traversal methods for in_order, pre_order, and post_order traversals
5. This class should have method tree_intersection that takes in two binary trees as input, and return a set of shared elements between this two trees.
